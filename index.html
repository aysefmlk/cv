  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>The most challenging job in the world is introducing yourself, at least for me. I’ve come across this question, and it’s almost a cliché you’ll hear often. I carry my name, and that’s all about me. But this time, I’ll give myself a try. <br />My
    name
    is Ayşe Faruk. I am 27 years old. I love to spend my spare time reading books. J. K Rowling is my favourite author. Besides J. K Rowling, Karen McManus, Paula Hawkins, Rachel Hawkins, Elif Shafak, Khaled Hosseini and Jojo Moyes inspire me A LOT!
    Besides book reading, I love gardening. To me, gardening is a therapy and a ritual. The time you spend in your garden is your therapy time too. You ultimately forget everything and develop a connection with the plants/nature. <br />I am in the
    kitchen
    when neither in the garden nor in the library! I can cook Italian, Turkish, Chinese, Arabic and even English cuisine! I love to cook and try new dishes. On a relatively lazy day, I prefer to stay in bed and binge-watch some British, American,
    German or Turkish seasons. It helped me with my listening skills and speaking skills. I love to travel, socialise and discover new places and people. I am enthusiastic about learning new languages and exploring foreign cultures.</p>
